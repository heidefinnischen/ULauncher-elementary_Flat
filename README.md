These are themes for ULauncher. An application launcher for Linux.

These themes were designed with elementaryOS in mind. Of course they still work on other distributions. They carefully recreate the look and feel of the Pantheon Desktop Environment, while still retaining some uniqueness.

Even if it doesnt look like it, the "Flat" themes are the heaviest themes in terms of code size. Who would've thought it would take so many workarounds to get a seperator (that only shows when ULauncher is showing list entries, so it doesnt overlap with the window corners) between the input box and the list entries without having a seperator between every list entry. The "Superflat" themes were much easier to create and need MUCH less workarounds to actually look and behave right and that's the only reason why I actually made these. I prefer the "Flat" themes, but they were so much work...

This is what the theme looks like on a desktop with a few open windows. It integrates seamlessly with the rest of the applications.

The preferences button is hidden until you need it. To find it just hover above the right end of the search bar. The clickable gear will appear and lead you right to the preferences pane of ULauncher.<br><br>

# More Themes

I have also made another four themes for ULauncher. They are also designed for elementary OS but they are a bit more pronounced. <p>
While both add seperators between list entries, the standard theme also introduces an input box that matches Slingshot.
